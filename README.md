> **Dynamic Text Analysis Platform for Advanced NLP Insights**

A comprehensive text analysis platform that combines cutting-edge machine learning with an intuitive web interface to extract themes, analyze sentiment, and generate actionable insights from textual data.



## üéØ Project Overview

AI Narrative Nexus is an 8-week development project aimed at creating a dynamic text analysis platform capable of processing various text inputs and providing comprehensive insights through:

- **Topic Modeling**: Identify key themes using LDA and NMF algorithms
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assess emotional tone with 90%+ accuracy
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise extractive and abstractive summaries
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Word clouds, sentiment distribution, topic graphs
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Actionable insights and recommendations

### Project Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: ‚úÖ Data Collection & Preprocessing (COMPLETE)
- **Week 3**: Topic Modeling Implementation
- **Week 4**: Sentiment Analysis
- **Week 5**: Insights Generation & Summarization
- **Week 6-7**: Visualization & Reporting
- **Week 8**: Final Evaluation & Documentation
